Welcome to HHVM! This section of our documentation is a hands-on guide for
people who want to learn about compiler and runtime internals. The goal is to
work through making, testing, and measuring a sample optimization to our
compiler. You'll make the most out of this guide if you work through the
exercises as you read it.
